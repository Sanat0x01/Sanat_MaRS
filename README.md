# 🚀 MaRS Recruitment - Software Task #1 (2025)

Welcome to my submission for **Software Task #1** from the MaRS Recruitment Team. This repository contains my completed solutions for the Light Dose and problems of the Medium Dose, all written in **C language**.

---

## 📌 Completed Tasks

### ✅ Light Dose
- Ubuntu commands and bash scripting (converted logic to C)

### ✅ Medium Dose (Partially Completed)
- 📐 **Camera coordinate correction** – Calculated object position after correcting misalignment.
- 📡 **Morse code decoding** – Interpreted signals and decoded into plain text.
- 🔐 **Encryption of message** – Decrypted the rover's encoded messages.

---

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language** (GCC)
- **Linux Terminal** for compilation and testing
- **Git** for version control

## ⚙️ Compilation

You can compile any of the C programs using:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
```


---

## 📷 Git and Terminal Usage

Screenshots of the following git commands are included:

```bash
git status
git add 
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push origin main
git remote set-url origin https://<token>/Sanat0x01/Sanat_MaRS
mkdir
cd
touch
find . -type f -name ".log"
gedit
cat
grep
wc -l
echo

```

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Improved command over **C programming** for system-level tasks.
- Practiced data parsing and transformation techniques.
- Understood how to simulate bash-like operations using C.
- Worked with coordinate geometry and string decoding algorithms.

---

## ✍️ Future Work

- Take on the Hard Dose challenges.
- Editing code for performance improvements.
